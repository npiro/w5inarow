***********************************************************************
What's new in version 1.6:
*New speed optimization (10-20% faster) by changing the board representation
from a 2D array to a 1D array.
*Minor tuning on the engine.
*Cleaned up the code.  
What's new in version 1.5:
*Incredible speed optimization: version 1.5 is 400% faster than 1.4 reaching speeds of
42000 nps on a 19x19 board in my PII@233 where the old versions reached 13000 nps. This is
due to a great improvement in the search algorithm that speeds things up considerably.
*Search extensions are now faster but still don't work well. They may be useful
in some positions and perjudicial in others. I still recommend not to use the search
extensions.
*Bug fixed in open game: after opening a game there was a problem with the clock time
that let the computer flag the human player immediately. Hopefuly this works well now. 
What's new in version 1.4b2:
*Fixed bug: the program would crash when the computer had to start a game with the
standard gomoku rules. The program now makes the only legal move in this 
initial position (J10) immediately without thinking.
What's new in version 1.4b:
*Fixed a bug that made the program crash when saving a game with a board different to 19x19.
*Fixed a bug that affected the time control: when the left mouse button was clicked when
it was the computer's turn something weird would happen to the clock.
*Added principal variation saving. The program now shows the best line it thought in the
Stats window.
 
What's new in version 1.4:
*Introduced iterative deepening to the search engine. This tecnique works the following
way: the engine searches at +1 ply progresively until a given search time is reached.
*The engine can now search for a given time thanks to iterated deepening. The search time
may be set by the user.
*Added timed game mode. If this mode is set a clock will appear on the screen and the
game will be played with a given time control. The time control may be set by the user
with the Set clock time menu item. Note that to play a timed game iterative deepening
must be enabled. If you enable the timed game option iterated deepening will be 
enabled automaticaly.
  With these two last options we now have three different game modes: fixed depth,
iterated deepening with a fixed search time per move, iterated deepening with
a time control for the whole game.
*Computer vs. computer games can now be played with given time controls for each
computer player. The old fixed search comp vs comp mode can still be used.
*Improved the window setup for the program. Now all the windows get automaticaly alligned
after opening, moving, or sizing the main window.
*Some other little refinements.
*Note: search extensions hasn't been improved yet so it is still advisable to avoid
using it. However, it seems to be a little more effective with iterated deepening.
 
What's new in version 1.3:
*Improved the board. It now looks three-dimensional (or maybe a bit). It also has
a smooth pattern that makes it look more realistic.
*Introduced another set of ticks. They are nicer and also three-dimensional. It is possible
to toggle between the new set and the old set.
*Introduced search extensions to the computer playing engine. It doesn't work very 
properly and it's quite slow so it isn't advisable to use this option yet.
*Move undoing is now possible with the Edit-Undo menu item. The number of undos in a 
game is unlimited.
*Introduced the version window that allows the user to see the program's version.
*Other little refinements to the engine and the user's interface.
*The help file, that was not updated in version 1.2 is now fully up-to-date.

What's new in version 1.2:

*Added multimedia sound: after a tick is placed, after a game is finished,... You can also
play midi files.
*Added letter and number coordinates to the board so the user can identify the move
in the Statistics window.

What's new in version 1.1:

*The window size can now be set manualy and it is set automaticaly,
when the program is executed, according to the screen resolution. This
way the window "fits" in the screen whatever the resolution is. In version
1.0 the window didn't fit in 640x480 resolution.
*Fixed a bug in the Edit Board option that didn't let the user select the
player to move after selecting Done. I also fixed another bug that
made the tick flash when an O tick was placed.
